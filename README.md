# school_donations
## Code Institute Stream 2 project 
## Philippe Guyard

This project is an example of data visualisation using data from [DonorsChoose.org](http://DonorsChoose.org) on school donations, broken down using various attributes such as state, focus area, resource type and others.

### Components used (from Code Institute Introduction to Dashboard):

* D3.js: A JavaScript based visualization engine, which will render interactive charts and graphs based on the data.
* Dc.js: A JavaScript based wrapper library for D3.js, which makes plotting the charts a lot easier.
* Crossfilter.js: A JavaScript based data manipulation library that enables two way data binding.
* Queue.js: An asynchronous helper library for JavaScript.
* Mongo DB: NoSQL Database used to convert and present our data in JSON format.
* Flask: A Python based  micro â€“ framework  used to serve our data from the server to our web based interface.

This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://shrouded-coast-13057.herokuapp.com/).
